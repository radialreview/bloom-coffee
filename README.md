# Bloom Coffee — Candidate Code Exercise

Welcome! This repo contains the exercise brief for **Bloom Coffee**, a small coffee-shop ordering app. Your job is to implement the stories below, deploy the app somewhere we can use it, and open a pull request. You may use any language, framework, or tools (including AI). We care about clarity, structure, and that it runs.

**Key docs:** [STORIES.md](STORIES.md) (stories & acceptance criteria) · [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md) (what we look for when reviewing)

---

## What we expect

1. **Fork this repo** and implement the stories in `STORIES.md`.
2. **Deploy** the app to a URL we can open (e.g. Vercel, Railway, Fly.io, your own server). No payment processing required.
3. The **customer-facing flow** (menu, order, confirmation) should be **mobile-friendly**: usable and readable on both phone and desktop. Admin can be desktop-only if you prefer.
4. **Open a pull request** back to our repo. In the PR description, include: **link to your deployed app**, **admin login credentials** (or how to create an admin), and optionally your **tech stack** and any **trade-offs or decisions** you want us to know about.
5. Our engineers will review your code and deployment. If we move forward, **Phase 2** will be a pairing session where you propose one or two features that would add business value to Bloom Coffee, we'll do a short planning together, and then you'll implement and deploy those with us.

**Time:** We've scoped this for about **2–3 hours** of focused work. You're welcome to take longer if you'd like—we'd rather you finish at your pace than feel rushed. We've kept the scope intentional so you can complete it without an overwhelming commitment. Please submit within one week of receiving this exercise.

**Questions?** Email Mike Benner at michael.b@bloomgrowth.com

## What we look for

Our engineers use a rubric when reviewing your submission. You can see what we evaluate and how we give feedback here: **[RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md)**.

## How to run (your app)

### Run locally

#### macOS

1. Install prerequisites (if not already installed):
   - [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
   - Ruby 3.2+ (recommended via a version manager such as `rbenv`/`mise`)
   - Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+
2. Clone the repo and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend && bundle install
   cd ../frontend && npm install
   ```
3. Configure backend env vars:
   - Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`
   - Update values if needed (`JWT_SECRET`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`)
4. Run backend migrations + seed:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   bundle exec rake db:migrate db:seed
   ```
5. Start backend:
   ```bash
   bundle exec rackup -p 4567
   ```
6. In a second terminal, start frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
7. Open `http://localhost:5173`.

#### Windows

Recommended: run this project through **WSL2 (Ubuntu)** for the smoothest Ruby setup.

1. Install:
   - WSL2 + Ubuntu
   - Ruby 3.2+ (inside WSL, recommended via `mise`/`rbenv`)
   - Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+ (inside WSL)
2. From your WSL terminal, follow the same commands as macOS:
   ```bash
   cd backend && bundle install
   cd ../frontend && npm install
   cd ../backend && bundle exec rake db:migrate db:seed
   bundle exec rackup -p 4567
   ```
   In a second WSL terminal:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:5173`.

### Deploy

- **Frontend:** Netlify
- **Backend + DB:** Render web service + Render Postgres
- **Live app URL:** [https://cool-pika-d2037a.netlify.app/](https://cool-pika-d2037a.netlify.app/)

### Admin login

- **Email:** `admin@bloom.coffee`
- **Password:** `password123`

## Repo structure (suggestion)

You don't have to follow this exactly; we only need to find the code and run it.

```
/
├── README.md              # This file (update with your run/deploy instructions)
├── STORIES.md             # Copy of the stories (for your reference; implementation is what we review)
├── docs/                  # Optional: any extra notes or decisions
├── <your-app>/            # Your choice: e.g. one app, or frontend/ + backend/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

Use one repo; monorepo or single app is fine. Keep it simple enough that we can clone, install, and run without guessing.

## Stories

See **[STORIES.md](STORIES.md)** for the five stories and acceptance criteria. Implement all of them; the order in the file is a suggested sequence.

Good luck — we're looking forward to seeing what you build.
